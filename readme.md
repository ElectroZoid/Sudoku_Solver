- to run the script -
    python3 sudo_sol.py path_to_testcases

- will create an output file (sol.txt) in the same folder where sudo_sol.py is present

- implementation with dictionary is slow (takes approx 43 sec to run 150 testcases corresponding to 9x9 grid given)

- if solution exists it outputs the answer as a single line but if it doesnt exists then it returns "No solution exists".
